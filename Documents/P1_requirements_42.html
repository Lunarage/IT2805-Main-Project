<h2>Our Client</h2>

<h2>Content of the website and organization</h2>
<ol>

<li><h3>“About”</h3>
SHORT INfo about they do, if possible a little “news” box where they can put recent happenings that they can easily update themselves.
</li>

<li><h3>“Identification projects”</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gallery for pictures that need to be identified</li>
<li>Sound gallery for files that need to be identified</li>
</ol>
<p>
Arkivet have old pictures and old recordings they need help to identify, at the time being they would like one for each but this may change.
It should be possible to have a description which is easy to update and there should also be a “button” of sorts that opens a new email with a pre-fixed subject that matches the ID/name of the picture so people can easily send an email to the right place if they know anything about it. (these functions should also be the same for the sound files)
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“General gallery and overviews”</h3>
<ol>
    <li>General gallery</li>
    <li>Overviews
    <ol>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Under Dusken</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
The general gallery is for showing off fun things from the archive, the overviews is for people to see what issues of UD they have and which books since they get a lot of inquiries from people that are looking for info from these.
It should also be easy to add more galleries and overviews so they can do it themselves later. There is also a need to inform about overviews that exist but they cant/wont put out on a public page so people need to send an email to get access to them.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Contact us”</h3>
<p>
Info, including: email addresses, address and information about office hours.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Daljer”</h3>
<p>
Information about lost and found for medals and  how to get a new one, there will be a need to put in some pictures in the text to “show” and not tell some key info.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Help us/wish list”</h3>
<p>
Here it will be info about thing the archive really want, and what they already and how to donate.
