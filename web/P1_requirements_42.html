<h2>Our Client</h2>
<h4>Client: Arkivet at Studentersamfundet</h4>
<h4>Contact person: Oda Sofie Øien Sundet, Leader of Arkivet</h4>
<p>
Arkivet is a group at Studentersamfundet responsible for archiving all documentation of the activity at Studentersamfundet.
As Studetersamfundet was established in 1909, they sit on a lot of data that needs to be identified and classified.
The last few years hey have been working on digitalization of old material but lack a channel for presenting this material.
As our entire group are active members of Studentersamfundet, we plan to create a website for Arkivet.
</p>

<h2>Purpose and goals</h2>
<p>
The website's purpose is to make the archive more accessible and help strengthening their presence at Studentersamfundet.
One specific goal is to create a platform where former and older members of Studentersamfundet can help identify old pictures and audio clips from old meetings etc.
Another goal is to create a landing page for people who generally want to contribute to the preservation of the history of Studentersamfundet.

<h2>Audience</h2>
<p>
The websites main audience will be the current and former members of Studentersamfundet and anyone else that might be interested in its history.
This audience includes people of all ages, from young adults to senior citizens.
This can be challenging as young people and old people interact with webpages in different ways.

<h2>Content of the website and organization</h2>
<ol class='h3list'>

<li><h3>“About”</h3>
A short description of who they are and what they do.
If possible a little “news” box should be added, where they can put recent happenings that they can easily update themselves.
</li>

<li><h3>“Identification projects”</h3>
<ol>
<li>Gallery for pictures that need to be identified</li>
<li>Audio gallery for clips that need to be identified</li>
</ol>
<p>
Arkivet have old pictures and old recordings they need help to identify.
At the time being they would like to have one gallery for pictures and one for audio, but this may change.
It should be possible to have a description and title which is easy to update.
There should also be a “button” of sorts that opens a new email with a pre-fixed subject that matches the ID/name of the picture so people can easily send an email to the right place if they know anything about it.
(these functions should also be the same for the audio clips)
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“General gallery and overviews”</h3>
<ol>
    <li>General gallery</li>
    <li>Overviews
    <ol>
        <li>Books</li>
        <li>Under Dusken</li>
    </ol>
    </li>
</ol>
<p>
The general gallery is for showing off select highlight of fun things from the archive.
The overviews are for people to see what issues of Under Dusken and which books they have since they get a lot of inquiries from people that are looking for info from these.
It should also be easy to add more galleries and overviews so they can do it themselves later.
There is also a need to inform about overviews that exist but can't/won't be put out on a public page.
It should be informed that people need to send an email to get access to them.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Contact us”</h3>
<p>
Contact information including: email addresses, postal address and information about office hours.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Daljer”</h3>
<p>
Information about lost and found for medals and how to get a new one.
There will be a need to put in some pictures in the text to “show” and not tell some key info.
</p>
</li>

<li><h3>“Help us/wish list”</h3>
<p>
This section will contain information about things the archive really want, what they already have and how to donate items.
</p>
</li>

</ol>

<h2>Specific preferences</h2>
<ul>
    <li>Not all members of Studentersamfundet speak Norwegian, so it should be an option to switch between Norwegian and English.</li>
    <li>As the targeted audience may have impaired eyesight, the site should be focused on universal design.</li>
    <li>The site should have a clean design with no distracting elements.</li>
    <li>To avoid a confusing website, all sections should be reachable within in three clicks.</li>
    <li>To avoid long loading times, only one picture in full resolution should be displayed at once.</li>
    <li>Because auto play is annoying, no audio should be played automatically. All media containing audio should be actively be started via buttons.</li>
</ul>
</section>

<h2>Final destination for the page</h2>
<p>
The site will be hosted at arkivet.samfundet.no which is maintained by the IT-department at Studentersamfundet.
The content of the site will be maintain by Arkivet.
</p>
</section>

<section>
<h2>Technical difficulties</h2>
<p>
Some of the content should be dynamic and changing.
To solve this without hard coding the pages with every change, the site needs to use some kind of back end.
As we are not allowed to use any back end for this project, we cannot fulfill this in the span of this project.
It will have to be added later.
We can, however, create a framework for communicating with a future back end.
