    <h2>Our Client</h2>
    <h4>Client: Arkivet at Studentersamfundet</h4>
    <h4>Contact person: Oda Sofie Ã˜ien Sundet, Leader of Arkivet</h4>
    <p>
    Arkivet is a group at Studentersamfundet responsible for archiving all documentation of the activity at Studentersamfundet.
    As Studetersamfundet was established in 1909, they sit on a lot of data that needs to be identified and classified.
    The last few years hey have been working on digitalization of old material but lack a channel for presenting this material.
    As our entire group are active members of Studentersamfundet, we plan to create a website for Arkivet.

        We simply forgot to think about this in the design phase.

    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>
        Modularity was achieved by using XMLHttpRequests and was implemented by Magne.
        This method was chosen because it will be easy to integrate with a back end at at later point in time.
        The header and footer is stored in separate files as indicated in the organizational scheme.
        The same method was used to retrieve data from json files.
        When this project is finished, the json data files will be replaced by a back end, using PostgreSQL and PHP, that essentially sends data in the same json format.
