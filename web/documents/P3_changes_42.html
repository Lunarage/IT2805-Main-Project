    <h2>Our Client</h2>
    <h4>Client: Arkivet at Studentersamfundet</h4>
    <h4>Contact person: Oda Sofie Ã˜ien Sundet, Leader of Arkivet</h4>
    <p>
    Arkivet is a group at Studentersamfundet responsible for archiving all documentation of the activity at Studentersamfundet.
    As Studetersamfundet was established in 1909, they sit on a lot of data that needs to be identified and classified.
    The last few years hey have been working on digitalization of old material but lack a channel for presenting this material.
    As our entire group are active members of Studentersamfundet, we plan to create a website for Arkivet.

    <h2>Changes to the original design</h2>
    <h3>Changes to the general design</h3>
    <p>
        The language flag has been moved to the menu in order to make it tidier with the mobile design.
        Text explicitly stating which language it changes to has also been added to the language flag.
        The footer is changed to be the same on desktop and mobile.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to arkiv.html</h3>
    <p>
        A search button was added to the written material part.
        We simply forgot to think about this in the design phase.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to daljer.html</h3>
    <p>
        The need for this page was miscommunicated and has thus been redefined.
        This page should contain a header and some paragraphs.
    </p>
    <h3>Changes to hjelp_oss.html</h3>
    <p>
        The customer requested that an album is to be added with pictures of objects they want donated.

    <h2>Fulfillment of Minimum Requirements</h2>
    <p>
        Magne implemented modularity and retrieving of data from JSON files. This is done through the function getData in functions.js.
    </p>
    <p>
        Adrian implemented functions for changing the styles of elements in elementManipulators.js.
    </p>
    <p>
        Kia and Magne implemented functions for reading JSON data and generating galleries for audio and pictures in galleryGenerator.js.
    </p>
    <p>
        The functions for reading JSON data and changing the language of the text accordingly was done per page.
        It is therefore done by the person who made a given page.

    <h2>Modularity</h2>
    <p>
        Modularity was achieved by using XMLHttpRequests and was implemented by Magne.
        This method was chosen because it will be easy to integrate with a back end at at later point in time.
        XMLHttpRequests are also supported by essentially all browsers.
        The header and footer is stored in separate files as indicated in the organizational scheme.
        The same method was used to retrieve data from json files.
        When this project is finished, the json data files will be replaced by a back end, using PostgreSQL and PHP, that essentially sends data in the same json format.
