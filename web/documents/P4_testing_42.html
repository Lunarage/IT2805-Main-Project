    <h2>Our Client</h2>
    <h4>Client: Arkivet at Studentersamfundet</h4>
    <h4>Contact person: Oda Sofie Ã˜ien Sundet, Leader of Arkivet</h4>
    <p>
    Arkivet is a group at Studentersamfundet responsible for archiving all documentation of the activity at Studentersamfundet.
    As Studetersamfundet was established in 1909, they sit on a lot of data that needs to be identified and classified.
    The last few years hey have been working on digitalization of old material but lack a channel for presenting this material.
    As our entire group are active members of Studentersamfundet, we plan to create a website for Arkivet.

    <h2>Testing Document</h2>
    <h3>Questionaire summary</h3>
        <p>
        The questionaire is divided into three parts:
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Introductory information, where questions are asked to establish the user's relationship with Studentersamfundet, their expectations, what device they are using and if they suffer from any visual impairments.</li>
            <li>Cases, where cases are presented for the user to solve to help get feedback in regards to the useability of the site.</li>
            <li>General feedback, where questions are asked to get some feedback regarding the general design of the website, e.g. the colours and language used.</li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Link to Google Form</h3>
    <p>
        The questionaire, made using Google Forms, can be found <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSczIWCK3ijL6xqqxlrWpqXFmMQy-XPFM261zHiHGaCfzU2PUw/viewform?usp=sf_link">here</a>. Note: It is only available in norwegian.

    <h2>Tester Audience</h2>
    <p>
        The target user group is mostly students and former students associated with Studentersamfundet; however, it is also preferrable to get feedback from people outside these groups. Users who have little to no association with Studentersamfundet will most likely have a different perspective and expectations as they will most likely have no idea of what Arkivet is.
    </p>
    <p>
        Regarding age, the target group has a wide span. Former students who are associated with Studentersamfundet have a tendency to return, and as they get older they are more likely to lose stuff when they visit. This fits well with one of the goals of Arkivet's website: To provide replacements for lost stuff such as medals.
    </p>
    <p>
        The target audience, and users in general, most likely use several types of devices to navigate the World Wide Web. It is therefore essential to test the website on users using different devices such as PC's and cellphones. It would also be beneficial to test the website on the visually impaired.
    </p>

    <h2>Testing Platforms</h2>
    <p>
        In general, most users used PC's with Google Chrome or Mozilla Firefox. Looking at platforms, around 70% used computers while the rest were cellphone and tablet. No user noted any slow loading, indicating that the website is of adequate speed.

    <h2>Feedbacks Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The target audience was partially reached, old and young people tested the website, as well as one person without any noteworthy association with Studentersamfundet. The website was also tested on all common platforms, with only one difference being spotted on the "Daljer"-page.
        In general, users were satisfied with the layout of the website and the functionality. The text was clear and readable on all platforms, though one user had problems reading the contact information on the "Identification" tab. Some users pointed out that a phone number would be nice to have on the contact info page.
        One flaw poitned out by several users was that the button for viewing images on the "Help Us"-page was difficult to find. Additionally, some users struggled with seperating "Identification" from "Help Us".
        Several users commented on some spelling errors and weird language, with some users pointing out the use of Lorem Ipsum/gibberish.

    <h2>Your Summary</h2>
    <p>
        The feedback we received was good and concise. The button for viewing the images on the "Help Us"-page can be made larger to be more visible. It will also be fixed to be available on the mobile website. The missing or hard to read text on the "Identification" tab can be moved up to make it readable when using Mozilla Firefox.
        Regarding the lack of a phone number on the "Contact" tab, it was not included due to the risk of being scraped by malicious users; however this could have been counter-acted by using a placeholder phone number on the website. This can be fixed in a later implementation of website by implementing a scraper-proof phone number entry.
        Regarding the language of the website, only some pages used for the survey were properly written, while others were filled with Lorem Ipsum due to lack of proper content. In hindsight, the lack of proper content should have been explained to the test users prior to telling them to go to the website for the test. The lack of text will be fixed in a later implementation when more content is available.

    <h2>Self-reflection</h2>
    <p>
        In general, the group thinks that the project has been a fun experience. It has sometimes been difficult managing the GitHub repository considering the amount of branches. It has been difficult at times to gather everyone at the same location, so most of the communication has been through Messenger, with tasks being gathered and displayed on Trello. This greatly helped us divide the work between us. Work on the project was halted for a couple of weeks due to UKA, so we would have liked for the website to have more relevant content instead of relying on Lorem Ipsum.
        The complexity of the website was increased by using JavaScript to load the website content dynamically; however, it was very beneficial in terms of understanding the capabilities of JavaScript, as well as providing a somewhat realistic depiction of how it is to develop websites today in the industry.
